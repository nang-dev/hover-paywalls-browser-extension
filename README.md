# Installation

## Download Locally: 
**Google Chrome**
1. Download this repo as a [ZIP file from GitHub](https://github.com/hover-inc/hover-extension/archive/master.zip).
2. Unzip the file and you should have a folder named `hover-extension-master`.
3. In Chrome go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).
4. Enable Developer Mode.
5. Drag the `dist` folder that is in `hover-extension-master` onto anywhere on the Chrome page to import it! (do not delete the folder afterwards)
6. Enjoy!

## Download from the Chrome Web Store (10,000+ Downloads + 5/5 Rating) (Down because Google does not allow bypassing paywalls):

# How To Use
Enable in Google Chrome, and you should see it on the top right along with the other extensions. \
To bypass paywalls on the website domain you're on, simply click on the "Bypass Paywalls" toggle button. \
It should work automatically! Enjoy :) \ \
If it doesn't work, go to advanced, and try different combinations of the strategies to bypass the paywall. Most of the time, enabling just one of them will do the trick, but it depends on the website. 

# How To Contribute
Fork the repository and improve Hover!
Make edits in src folder, and then run ```npm run build```. This will create the dist folder, which is used by browsers (see Download Locally Step 5).

Current stable version: 2.2.7
Dev version: 2.2.8

## Next Steps
Transfer into a Firefox extension. \
Make Hover work for more sites. \
Try to get back onto Google Chrome Store.
